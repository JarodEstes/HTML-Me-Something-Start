            <h4>First Match</h4>
         <p>
            The first match that took place was nearly 0 degrees outside. The ground was completely frozen over along with ice caked on the top.
            Before the game we all huddled in a tent to keep warm. The game went about as you'd expect, but fortunately we did win this game.
         </p>

         <h4>Second Match</h4>
         <p>
            Second match is a bit warmer now. We lose this match in a tough game. Both teams are feeling the affects of being in minimal clothing
            while playing rugby.

         <h4>Third Match</h4>
         <p>
            Our third match would be our final. We fall in this one to lose out of the tournament, but there was a silver lining in that.
            We lost one player to a dislocated shoulder, and another to a hurt ankle. We were beyond struggling to breath at this point.
