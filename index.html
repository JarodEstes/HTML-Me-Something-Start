            <h4>First Match</h4>
         <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">The first match that took place was nearly 0 degrees outside. The ground was completely frozen over along with ice caked on the top.
            Before the game we all huddled in a tent to keep warm. The game went about as you'd expect, but fortunately we did win this game.</p>

         <h4>Second Match</h4>
         <p class="funParagraph"> Second match is a bit warmer now. We lose this match in a tough game. Both teams are feeling the affects of being in minimal clothing
            while playing rugby. Despite this fact, another teammate and I went to play for another team to help them after our game. I was new
            rugby so I wanted the experience. This was a brutal mistake by me.</p>

         <h4>Third Match</h4>
         <p class="funParagraph">Our third match would be our final. I wanted to die during this game multiple times. This was one of the harder things I've ever pushed myself through.
            There were times where I could not stand up straight because my body was trying to give up. Unfornutely, we fall in this one to lose out of the tournament, but there was a silver lining in that.
            We lost one player to a dislocated shoulder, and another to a hurt ankle. We were beyond struggling to breath at this point.</p>
